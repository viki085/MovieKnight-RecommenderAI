       "AIMessage(content=\"<think>\\nOkay, so the user is asking who acted in The Matrix. Let me start by recalling the main cast. Keanu Reeves plays Neo, right? And Laurence Fishburne is Morpheus. Carrot Top is Mr. Smith, I think. Wait, no, Carrot Top is actually the character Mr. Anderson, the leader of the machines, but his name is Smith? Wait, maybe I'm mixing up the names. Let me get that straight. Mr. Anderson is the human character who becomes the leader of the machines. Oh, right, the character is named Smith, but his real name is Thomas Anderson, which is the name Neo starts with. So the actor playing Mr. Smith is Hugo Weaving. Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, Mr. Anderson is the human who becomes the leader of the machines. So the actor is Hugo Weaving? Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused here.\\n\\nWait, let me check. Neo's real name is Thomas Anderson, and he's played by Keanu Reeves. Then there's the character Mr. Smith, who is the leader of the machines. But the actor who plays Mr. Smith is Hugo Weaving. Wait, no, I think that's incorrect. Wait, no, Mr. Smith is the program that's controlling the machines, right? Wait, maybe I'm mixing up the Matrix Reloaded and Matrix Revolutions. Let me think again.\\n\\nIn The Matrix (1999), the main characters are Neo (Keanu Reeves), Trinity (Carrie-Anne Moss), Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne), Cypher (Joe Pantoliano), and the Architect (Paul Giamatti). Then there's the character of Mr. Smith, but I'm getting confused. Wait, Mr. Smith is actually the name of the program that's a virus in the Matrix. But in the first movie, the main antagonist is Agent Smith, played by Keanu Reeves. Wait, no, that can't be right. Wait, in The Matrix, the agents are Smith, Brown, and Jones. The main one is Agent Smith, who is played by Hugo Weaving. Wait, yes! Hugo Weaving plays Agent Smith. That's correct. So in the first movie, Agent Smith is played by Hugo Weaving. Then in the sequels, Agent Smith is played by Keanu Reeves in some form because Neo becomes Smith, but that's in the later movies.\\n\\nSo putting this together, the main cast of The Matrix (1999) includes:\\n\\n- Keanu Reeves as Neo (Thomas Anderson)\\n- Laurence Fishburne as Morpheus\\n- Carrie-Anne Moss as Trinity\\n- Joe Pantoliano as Cypher\\n- Hugo Weaving as Agent Smith\\n- Robert Taylor as Tank\\n- Marcus Chong as Mouse\\n- Hugo Weaving as Agent Smith (again for clarity)\\n- Also, in some minor roles, there's the Oracle (Gloria Foster), but she's not in the main cast but is a significant character.\\n\\nWait, the Oracle is played by Gloria Foster. Also, the Architect is played by Paul Giamatti, but that's from the sequels. The first movie doesn't have the Architect, that's in Reloaded.\\n\\nSo the main actors in The Matrix are Keanu Reeves, Laurence Fishburne, Carrie-Anne Moss, Joe Pantoliano, Hugo Weaving as Agent Smith, Robert Taylor, Marcus Chong, etc. Also, the Wachowskis directed it, but the user is asking about the actors, not the directors.\\n\\nI need to make sure I'm not mixing up which actors are in which movies. The user is specifically asking about The Matrix (1999), not the sequels. So focusing on that. Let me confirm each actor's role again:\\n\\n- Keanu Reeves: Neo/Thomas Anderson\\n- Laurence Fishburne: Morpheus\\n- Carrie-Anne Moss: Trinity\\n- Joe Pantoliano: Cypher\\n- Hugo Weaving: Agent Smith\\n- Robert Taylor: Tank\\n- Marcus Chong: Mouse\\n- Gloria Foster: The Oracle (though she has a small role)\\n- Also, there's a scene where Neo is in the Matrix as Thomas Anderson, but that's his character, played by Reeves.\\n\\nWait, I think that's the main cast. Let me check if there are any others. Maybe some other minor roles, but the user is probably looking for the main actors. So the answer should list the main cast with their characters. I need to present this clearly, making sure the names and roles are correct. Also, note that in the first movie, Agent Smith is played by Hugo Weaving, not Keanu Reeves. Keanu plays Neo, and in the sequels, there's a transformation where Neo becomes Smith, but that's in Matrix Reloaded and Revolutions, so not part of the first movie.\\n</think>\\n\\nThe main cast of *The Matrix* (1999) includes the following actors and their roles:\\n\\n- **Keanu Reeves** as **Neo** (Thomas Anderson), the protagonist who discovers the truth about the Matrix.  \\n- **Laurence Fishburne** as **Morpheus**, a leader of the human resistance.  \\n- **Carrie-Anne Moss** as **Trinity**, Neo's love interest and a skilled fighter.  \\n- **Joe Pantoliano** as **Cypher**, a member of the resistance who later betrays them.  \\n- **Hugo Weaving** as **Agent Smith**, the primary antagonist and a powerful program in the Matrix.  \\n- **Robert Taylor** as **Tank**, a crew member on the *Nebuchadnezzar*.  \\n- **Marcus Chong** as **Mouse**, the ship's hacker.  \\n- **Gloria Foster** as **The Oracle**, a mysterious figure who provides cryptic guidance.  \\n\\nAdditional notable roles include:\\n- **Bridgette Wilson** as **Mouse's friend** (a minor role).  \\n- **Marcus Chong** also voices the **Mouse** character.  \\n\\nThe film was directed by the **Wachowskis** (Lana Wachowski and Lilly Wachowski) and is widely celebrated for its groundbreaking visual effects and philosophical themes.\", additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={'token_usage': {'completion_tokens': 1310, 'prompt_tokens': 14, 'total_tokens': 1324, 'completion_time': 3.89864912, 'completion_tokens_details': None, 'prompt_time': 0.00067169, 'prompt_tokens_details': None, 'queue_time': 0.04758996, 'total_time': 3.89932081}, 'model_name': 'qwen/qwen3-32b', 'system_fingerprint': 'fp_5cf921caa2', 'service_tier': 'on_demand', 'finish_reason': 'stop', 'logprobs': None, 'model_provider': 'groq'}, id='lc_run--019c6a97-1afb-7881-9a55-544895721bd1-0', tool_calls=[], invalid_tool_calls=[], usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 14, 'output_tokens': 1310, 'total_tokens': 1324})"
